## AWS Comprehend Reference Architecture

Amazon Comprehend can be integrated into a cloud workflow to analyze large-scale customer reviews automatically.  
The diagram below shows a reference architecture provided by AWS:

### Workflow Explanation
1. **Customer Review Upload**: Reviews are uploaded into an Amazon S3 bucket.  
2. **Event Trigger**: An event (new file in bucket) triggers a Lambda function.  
3. **Sentiment Analysis**: The Lambda function calls the **Amazon Comprehend API** to analyze sentiment.  
4. **Results Storage**: The sentiment results are saved into another folder in S3.  
5. **Querying**: Amazon Athena allows interactive querying of sentiment results directly from S3.  

### Relation to This Project
In this project, the workflow is simplified:
- Data preprocessing and uploads were performed manually.  
- Sentiment analysis was handled through **Amazon Comprehend** and traditional ML models in SageMaker.  
- Visualization and evaluation were completed directly in Jupyter notebooks instead of Athena.
